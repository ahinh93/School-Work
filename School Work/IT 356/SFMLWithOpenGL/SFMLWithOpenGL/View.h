 * we are using glm, a mathematics library for OpenGL
 * glm has two advantages:
 * 1. It is based on the GLSL specification. That is, all the data structures, functions and algorithms it offers
 *    follow the same convention as GLSL shaders. Therefore the transition to GLSL will be very smooth.
 * 2. glm is completely header-based. Thus there are no libraries or dlls to link to. This makes it very portable.
